# Base Reqs
~~A list box should list "All Music" and all playlists.  
When All Music is selected, all the songs should be displayed in the data grid.  
When a specific playlist is selected, only songs from that playlist should be displayed in the data grid.~~

~~Songs should be displayed in a data grid control that shows each song’s title, artist, album, and genre only. 
The data grid should not be editable.~~

~~A song can be played by selecting the song in the data grid pressing the Play button 
or by right-clicking the song and selecting “Play” from the context menu.  
The Stop button should stop a playing song.  Other buttons that pause, change the volume,
or advance to the next song would be helpful but are not required.  When a song is finished playing,
ideally your app should advance to the next song in the list, but this is not a requirement.~~

~~A toolbar should be used instead of a menu. The toolbar should have a button for adding a song, 
adding a new playlist, and showing the About dialog box. Use images and hints for each button.~~

~~The app should allow songs to be added to the listing of songs by launching an open dialog box
and allowing the user to select a song.  Provide a filter that by default shows
.mp3, .m4a, .wma, and .wav files in the open file dialog box.  After selecting a song,
the program should read the metadata stored in the music file (if available),
add the song to the data grid, and select/highlight the song (so the user can see it among the list of potentially hundreds of songs).~~  

~~The user should be able to create a new playlist by selecting a New Playlist button from the toolbar
and be prompted in a dialog box for a playlist name. Songs can be added to a playlist by dragging them
from the grid control and dropping them onto the desired playlist in the list box. 
Each song that is dropped onto a playlist should be added to the end of the playlist.  
When viewing a playlist, the songs should be presented in order of position.~~  

~~Songs can be removed from the list of All Music by right-clicking the song and selecting “Remove” from the context menu.
A dialog box should confirm the removal. A song can be removed from a playlist by viewing the songs in the playlist, 
right-clicking the song, and selecting “Remove from Playlist” from the context menu.  No dialog box is necessary.  
Note that the ordering of the songs in a playlist should be updated to reflect the removal of a song so if song at 
position 2 was removed, the 3rd song is now position 2, the 4th is position 3, and so on.~~

~~The list of all song files and playlists should be stored in a file called music.xml. 
This file should reside in the same folder as the app’s .exe. 
The file should be loaded when the app is first executed and saved when the app terminates.  
(Ideally the file should be saved whenever a change is made to a playlist, but you should only save it once when the app terminates.)~~

~~The main window should be resizable, and the contents should stretch/shrink to fit the size of the window.~~

~~An about dialog box (not a simple MessageBox) should identify the programmers.~~

# Additional Reqs
~~Add the ability to rename and delete a playlist.  The user should be able to right-click a playlist 
and select "Rename" from the context menu.  Then a dialog box should display which allows the user to rename the playlist. 
Make sure you only change the playlist name if the user supplies a valid playlist (no blanks or identically named playlists). 
A "Delete" option should also be available from the context menu that deletes the playlist.~~

~~Use a control template or styles with at least one trigger to alter the look and behavior of the Play and Stop buttons. 
Also add Play and Stop commands (from MediaCommands class) to the buttons so the Play
and Stop buttons are disabled if no song is selected (for Play) or no song is playing (for Stop).~~

Allow the user to enter a search string. As the string is being entered, the song list should be populated
with any song whose title, artist, album, or genre match any part of the search string. 
An empty search string should yield all songs. (Use the DataView.RowFilter to build a LIKE statement 
that filters only the rows matching the search string.)
